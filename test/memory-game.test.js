/*
  Note on week 6 there were some test issues where two different parts of the
  assignment called their own onReady function. The tests were confusing which
  onReady goes with which test and causing tests to fail unexpectedly. To fix
  this we named one onReady2. This isn't a great solution, but the other option
  would be to follow the module pattern, which is not a pattern we teach and
  would be extra confusing for students.
